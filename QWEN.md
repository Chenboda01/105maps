# 105maps Project Context

## Project Overview
105maps is a digital maps application similar to Google Maps, designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The project provides basic mapping features such as:
- Zooming
- Panning
- Location search

The application aims to offer quick navigation and location finding without the complexity of advanced functionalities found in other mapping solutions.

## Technology Stack
The project will primarily use JavaScript for frontend development, with optional Python components for backend services and data processing. A mixture of both technologies may be used to create a comprehensive mapping solution.

## Repository Information
The source code and documentation for 105maps are hosted in the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/Chenboda01/105maps](https://github.com/Chenboda01/105maps)

## Current Directory Context
This local directory (`/home/bodachen/105maps`) appears to be a placeholder or documentation-only directory that references the main GitHub repository. The actual development work and codebase are located in the remote repository.

## Purpose
The project is intended to provide a simplified mapping experience for users who need basic navigation and location services without the complexity of feature-rich mapping applications.

## Usage Context
As an interactive CLI agent, I'm working in this directory to provide assistance related to the 105maps project. For detailed code analysis, modifications, or development work, the actual repository at the GitHub link should be referenced.

## Development Notes
Since the main codebase is in the GitHub repository, any development tasks, bug fixes, or feature implementations should be performed there. This local directory serves as a reference point or documentation hub for the project.
