105maps is a digital maps similar to Google Maps, but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. It provides basic mapping features such as zooming, panning, and location search without the complexity of advanced functionalities. You can use 105maps for quick navigation and location finding.

The project will primarily use JavaScript for frontend development, with optional Python components for backend services and data processing. A mixture of both technologies may be used to create a comprehensive mapping solution.

Development is planned for a GitHub repository, but currently all work is in this local directory. The GitHub repository mentioned previously does not yet exist.

This directory contains the complete implementation of the 105maps project.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or report issues. Happy mapping!
